This is the Top-Games/Top-Serveurs (https://top-games.net / https://top-serveurs.net) new votes plugin (currently in beta) which is used to receive votes directly on your FiveM/RedM server. When a player votes, Top-Games directly notifies your server and you can thus reward your players or make a ranking of the best voters (by example), the possibilities are endless.

But what is FiveM for? [FiveM](https://top-games.net/gta/type/fivem) allows you to create a GTA server, you can find in particular a [GTA 5 RP](https://top-games.net/gta/type/roleplay) on our site.

## Features

- Event `onPlayerVote` allowing the reception of the votes cast on your server file in real time! This therefore allows actions to be taken accordingly. Example: rewarding voters.

## Installation

1. Copy the plugin content in the `vote` directory to the `resources` directory of your FiveM/RedM server
2. Configure the voting plugin in your `server.cfg` file like this:

```ini
ensure vote
# The token is mandatory. It is the token of your server file available on your panel https://top-games.net
set vote_token "XXXXXXXXX"
# The listening port of the plugin. Default is port 8192 but you can specify which one you want. Do not forget to configure it also on the management panel of your server on https://top-games.net/gta
set vote_port "8192"
```
**Remember to open the chosen port (for example 8192) in UDP on your server/firewall**.

3. Use the `onPlayerVote` event to receive the votes cast. An example is available in the `example.lua` file and in the `example_esx.lua` file for a small example with ESX (remember to delete the examples). Here is an example:

```lua
AddEventHandler('onPlayerVote', function (playername, ip, date)
    -- Add actions here when a vote is received.
    -- For example: give In-Game money, give points, save in DB, ...
    print(playername)
    print(ip)
    print(date)
end)
```

4. Start your server. If you see the message `[VotePlugin] Voting plugin active on port xxxx`, everything is fine!

5. Last step: activate the voting plugin on the management panel of your server file. Go to https://top-games.net/gta in your server management, at the bottom there is a `Voting plugin` section. You need to activate the plugin and specify the port you indicated above in your `server.cfg` file. Once the plugin is activated, you can click on the button to test the connectivity and then it's up to you!
