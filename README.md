# Votes plugin for FiveM / RedM servers (Cfx)

- [:us: English documentation](./README.md)
- [:fr: Documentation fran√ßaise](./README_FR.md)

This is the Top-Games/Top-Serveurs (https://top-games.net / https://top-serveurs.net) new votes plugin which is used to receive votes directly on your FiveM/RedM server. When a player votes, Top-Games directly notifies your server and you can thus reward your players or make a ranking of the best voters (by example), the possibilities are endless.

But what is FiveM for? [FiveM](https://top-games.net/gta/type/fivem) allows you to create a GTA server, you can find in particular a [GTA 5 RP](https://top-games.net/gta/type/roleplay) on our site.

## Features

- Event `onPlayerVote` allowing the reception of the votes cast on your server file in real time! This therefore allows actions to be taken accordingly. Example: rewarding voters.

## Installation

1. Copy the `cfx-vote-plugin` directory to the `resources` directory of your FiveM/RedM server

2. Configure the voting plugin in your `server.cfg` file like this:

```ini
ensure cfx-vote-plugin
# The token is mandatory. It is the token of your server file available on your panel https://top-games.net
set vote_token "XXXXXXXXX"
```

3. Use the `onPlayerVote` event to receive the votes cast. Some examples are available in the `example.lua` file, in the `example_esx.lua` file for a small example with ESX and in the `example_vorp.lua` file for an example with the VORP framework (remember to delete the example files you don't need). Also, here is a basic example:

```lua
AddEventHandler('onPlayerVote', function (playername, ip, date)
    -- Add actions here when a vote is received.
    -- For example: give In-Game money, give points, save in DB, ...
    print(playername)
    print(ip)
    print(date)
end)
```

4. Start your server. If you see the message `[VotePlugin] The vote plugin is active on the default server port`, everything is fine!

5. Last step: activate the voting plugin on the management panel of your server file. Go to https://top-games.net/gta in your server management, at the bottom there is a `Voting plugin` section. You need to activate the plugin by choosing "Vote plugin v3". Once the plugin is activated, you can click on the button to test the connectivity and then it's up to you!
